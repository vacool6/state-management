# Comparing State management with simple todo application

Managing / Accessing states on global level can be accomplished by
using in-build state management via `Context API`, `useReducer` or by any extrnal libraries like : `Redux toolkit`, `Zoostand` etc.

In this project we compare state management techniques using context API, useReducer and Redux toolkit.

## Setup

There are 4 branches:

1 ) `on/reduxToolkit` : On this branch Todo app is implemented using Redux toolkit.  

2 ) `on/contextAPI` : On this branch Todo app is implemented using Context API. 

3 ) `on/useReducer` :  On this branch Todo app is implemented using useReducer hook. 

4 ) `club/context+reducer` : On this branch Todo app is implemented using Context API & useReducer hook. 

## Getting started

1 ) Need to have nodejs installed.

2 ) Installing dependencies: `yarn` or `npm install` or `npm i`

3 ) `git switch <branch name>` to switch to desired branch.

4 ) To run the app yarn `start` or `npm start`
